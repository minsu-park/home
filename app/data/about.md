#### Welcome!
I am a PhD candidate in [Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Michael W. Macy](https://sociology.cornell.edu/michael-macy) and [Mor Naaman](https://people.jacobs.cornell.edu/mor/). My general areas of interest are computational social science and human-centered data science. I am particularly interested in applying computational techniques to the social and social psychological mechanisms that underlie how people construct meaning and consequently pursue action through cultural consumption behaviors. My research is deeply informed by insights from sociology and social computing. There are three strands to my work: 

- understanding the relationship between social position and cultural taste at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., individual and cross-national);

- modeling and analyzing the dynamics of preferences (e.g., daily and seasonal patterns of variety-seeking behaviors and affective preference as self-exposure to external stimuli such as music);

- resolving common challenges in the use of social media data (e.g., imputing user attributes such as socioeconomic status) as well as in improving the interpretability of machine learning models.

#### News
- Jan 21, 2019 <p>Excited to announce that my paper on [temporal dynamics of affective preference](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0508-z) is finally published at ***Nature Human Behaviour***! You may find some useful information like a non-paywalled link to the full text in [this tweet thread](https://twitter.com/mansumansu/status/1088117173778821121).</p>
