      + 'In particular, we focus on how people use common external stimuli such as music to achieve a certain psychological end. '
      + 'We build computational tools and techniques and draw on theories from a wide range of fields to address questions '
      + 'that pertain to individual\'s self-exposure mechanisms to affective stimuli and the outcome of the affective consumption. '
      + 'In the first study, we conducted an exhaustive descriptive analysis on '
      + 'dirunal and seasonal patterns of affective preference using large-scale streaming data from Spotify. '
      + 'For a follow-up study, we are building sensing technologies to collect continuous physiological data '
      + 'and analyze signals of mood management as they occur naturally outside of lab settings.',

    + 'to identify and predict migration patterns; whether digital communications attenuate or echo the cultural, religious, and ethnic fault lines; '
    + 'and how cultural values affect the norm of non-verbal expressions like emoticons as well as '
    + 'the choice of cultural contents like online videos â€“ to name just a few examples. We are particularly interested in '
    + 'doing research on research on how cultural tastes, consumption preferences, and other individual interests spread across the globe.',
